Customer Payment Behavior Analysis Dashboard
Customer Payment Behavior Analysis Dashboard
This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze and visualize customer payment behavior in a real estate sales environment. The solution is designed to empower sales, finance, and operations teams with data-driven insights for proactive decision-making and risk management.

The dashboard tracks how clients engage with installment-based property purchases — offering visibility into payment trends, defaulter patterns, revenue status, and agent performance. This is especially valuable in property businesses where customer retention, cash flow forecasting, and timely customer follow-ups are critical to success.

The dataset includes key fields such as customer ID, estate name, number of plots bought, total purchase amount, payment frequency, payment method, and contract timelines (start and end dates). Additional analytical fields — including last payment date, expected vs. actual installment counts, missed payments, and days since last payment — were derived to enable in-depth behavioral analysis. Customers are also categorized by follow-up status (e.g., “Up to date”, “Pending call”, “Escalated”), defaulter status, and a calculated Customer Risk Score that ranks payment reliability using multiple behavioral indicators.

The Power BI dashboard features a wide range of interactive visuals:

Total customers, defaulters count and percentage

Average payment behavior and outstanding balances

Defaulters segmented by agent and registration channel

Payment performance by estate, customer occupation, and payment frequency

Revenue trends and agent contributions

Follow-up status distribution for customer service prioritization

DAX measures were used extensively to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), risk scores, and dynamic filters. Excel was used for initial data preparation, feature engineering, and enrichment.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data modeling, storytelling with data, dashboard design, and business analytics. It highlights the ability to turn raw transactional data into actionable insights for teams seeking to improve customer engagement, reduce default rates, and make informed strategic decisions.
